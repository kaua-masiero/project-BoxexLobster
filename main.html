                <p>Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic things—detect light, and
                    convert it into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous variety of ways. There are single and
                    compound
                    eyes, bifocal lenses and rocky ones, mirrors and optic fibres. And there are eyes that are so alien,
                    so
                    constantly surprising, that after decades of research, scientists have only just about figured out
                    how
                    they work, let alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need to go for a swim.

                    This is the eye of a <span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp">mantis
                            shrimp</a></span>—an marine animal that’s neither a mantis nor a shrimp, but a
                    close relative of crabs and lobsters. It’s a compound eye, made of thousands of small units that
                    each detects light independently. Those in the midband—the central stripe you can see in the
                    photo—are special. They’re the ones that let the animal see colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people have three types of light-detecting cells, or photoreceptors, which are sensitive to
                    red, green and blue light. But the mantis shrimp has anywhere from 12 to 16 different photoreceptors
                    in its midband. Most people assume that they must therefore be really good at seeing a wide range of
                    colours—a “thermonuclear bomb of light and beauty”, as the Oatmeal put it. But last year, Hanna
                    Thoen from the University of Queensland found that they’re much worse at discriminating between
                    coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating
                    between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at
                    discriminating between colours than most other animals! They seem to use their dozen-plus receptors
                    to recognise colours in a unique way that’s very different to other animals but oddly similar to
                    some satellites.

                    Thoen focused on the receptors that detect colours from red to violet—the same rainbow we can see.
                    But these ultra-violent animals can also see ultraviolet (UV). The rock mantis shrimp, for example,
                    has six photoreceptors dedicated to this part of the spectrum, each one tuned to a different
                    wavelength. That’s the most complex UV-detecting system found in nature. Michael Bok from the
                    University of Maryland wanted to know how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like us, mantis shrimps see colour with the help of light-sensitive proteins called opsins. These
                    form the basis of visual pigments that react to different wavelengths of light, allowing us to see
                    different colours. If a mantis shrimp has six UV receptors, it should have at least six opsins that
                    are sensitive to different flavours of UV.
